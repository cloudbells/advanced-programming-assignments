## How to Run
For building locally, use your favourite IDE to start a new project and add the appropriate packages (section1 for assignments under section 1 etc.) to the project. Add the corresponding .java files to the package and build, then run.

For usage with [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/) simply copy all the code of the relevant assignment, then delete the package declaration, remove the ``public`` qualifier for the class, and rename the class to ``Main`` and update any references as necessary.
